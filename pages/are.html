        Hi! I'm sorry that you had go through all these challenges but it was
        necessary (because I coudn't write a paper letter without mistakes so I
        decided it would be easier to make this website, nevermind). So, what I
        want wanted to say is I don't want you to push yourself to read these
        books or watch videos for these books. I want you to do it if only
        you're interested in it, anything else doesn't matter. And also I'm
        sorry for the poor quality of the books ;)
      </p>
